- ðŸ‘‹ Yo, Iâ€™m @Kieran-JP,  Iâ€™m currently learning HNC Cyber Security at City of Glasgow College and Iâ€™m looking to use Github to plant my feet in the computing space.
- Im pretty new to all of this and im unsure of the path to take, so im hoping that I can gain a further understanding of Security and start getting in some extra-curicular work.

- To those interested you can contact me by my email or @rum7824 on Discord
- Happy Trails :)
